# vcf-msp

This repository contains Python/R/C++ code for working with VCF and MSP files. It is used and maintained by the Reynolds Lab at Baylor University.

## What the project does

Currently, there are no scripts here that are ready for use. The goal is to have files in different programming languages that define functions for various tasks. Right now, the first priority is to make a function that will omit information in a VCF file based on corresponding ancestry information in an MSP file.

Run ``main.py`` by using the command line: python [path_to_VCF_file] [path_to_MSP_file]

## Why the project is useful

Although making custom programs to work with VCF files is generally frowned upon because of the volatile development history of the VCF format, not all problems in computational biology can be resolved with the same modules in the same package. Furthermore, with all the different formats that researchers use, there is no reasonable way to expect a single development team at a university to respond to every request from researchers. A repository for active researchers and by active researchers resolves this problem.
