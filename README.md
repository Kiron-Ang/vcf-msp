# vcf-msp
This repository contains Python/R/C++ code for working with VCF and MSP files. This is used and maintained by the Reynolds Lab at Baylor University.
# What the project does
Currently, there are no scripts here that are ready for use. I am currently working on a script that will omit information in a VCF file based on corresponding ancestry information in an MSP file.
# Why the project is useful
Although making custom programs to work with VCF files is generally frowned upon because of the voltaile development history of the VCF format, not all problems in computational biology can be resolved with the same scripts in the same package. Furthermore, with all the different formats that researchers use, there is no reasonable way to expect a development team at a university to respond to every single request from other researchers. This repository contains some programs by fellow researchers that others may find helpful.
